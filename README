# Themed Card Battle Game
> _by Duany Espíndola_

## Summary

This will be an online, turn-based card game where the goal is to bring your opponent’s life points down to zero.

I’m using this project as a way to learn new technologies, like Go for the backend.

For the frontend, I’d like to use Flutter, but I've never used that tech before. 

So, to get things up and running, I’ll start with Vue.js for a simple MVP (with a very basic design) just to make sure everything works. Once that’s in place, I’ll migrate to Flutter.

## Documentation

- [Project Requirements](./docs/project-requirements-document.md)
- [Testing](./docs/tests.md)

## Learning Goals

- Dev and production enviroment using containers.
- Coding with BDD/TDD.
- Use microservices
- Automated CI/CD

_Look, I won't be able to follow all of this immediately. The plan is to tweak the project as I learn more and more about these things._

### Sources 
- The best source to learn go and testing with go, for me at least, is the site https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests
